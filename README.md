# Efficientnet-pytorch

In this repository, you will be fine-tuning an EfficientNet Model based on your selected dataset. 

First, ensure all requirements are satisfied as detailed in requirements.txt.

Next, change specified details in "local_training.py" (project name, dataset name, local path where dataset will be downloaded).

You can also configure the pretrained Efficientnet version, number of classes in your dataset, image size and number of channels.

You will only need to run the 'local_training' file which will produce model performance graphs and save the best performing model weights.
